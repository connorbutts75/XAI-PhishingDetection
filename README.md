XAI-PhishingDetection-Web
This code works on Python 3.13 and Flask

The following libraries that are needed are in requirements.txt

When downloading the repository, the model will be missing a critical file. This file can be found in announcements as models.safetensor because it is the only place where I could upload it because of its size. You will need to download it and place it in the XAI-PhishingDetection-Web\AI folder for the project to work.

To start the code, you will run app.py for it to start.
